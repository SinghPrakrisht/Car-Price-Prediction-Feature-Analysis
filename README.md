# Car Price Prediction and Feature Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting car prices and analyzing key features that influence vehicle pricing.
The complete workflow follows all steps outlined in the Mini Project Guide, including data cleaning,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical inference, model building, and interpretation.

The objective is to understand how different car attributes impact price and to build an effective
machine learning model for price prediction.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle  
- Dataset: Car Dataset by Cooper Union  
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset

The dataset contains various attributes such as:
- Make and Model
- Engine specifications
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Vehicle size and style
- Highway and city mileage
- Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed missing and inconsistent values
- Handled outliers affecting price distribution
- Converted categorical variables for analysis

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of car prices
- Relationship between price and engine features
- Impact of fuel type, transmission, and vehicle class
- Correlation analysis between numerical variables

### 3️⃣ Feature Analysis & Statistical Inference
- Identified most influential features affecting car prices
- Used correlation and statistical reasoning to justify feature selection

### 4️⃣ Model Building
- Built regression-based machine learning models
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Evaluated performance using appropriate metrics

### 5️⃣ Interpretation & Insights
- Engine power and vehicle category significantly influence pricing
- Luxury and performance vehicles show higher price variance
- Feature selection improves prediction accuracy
